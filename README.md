This repository follows the following tutorial:
[Youtube playlist of Learn Bevy 0.10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQt-v_bFdao&list=PLVnntJRoP85JHGX7rGDu6LaF3fmDDbqyd)

Original repositories:
- [learn-bevy](https://github.com/frederickjjoubert/learn-bevy)
- [bevy-ball-game](https://github.com/frederickjjoubert/bevy-ball-game)

Most of the work in this repository is typed after the tutorial, almost nothing is my own work here.
I recommend checking out the original repositories and YouTube video series.
